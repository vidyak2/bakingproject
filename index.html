    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>The day I first baked chocolate muffins, I never would have thought I would develop a baking obsession. Today, my favorite part of the kitchen is the baking supplies I have, starting from my pink stand mixer, to my colorful measuring cups and spoons.</p>
    <p>I do not consider myself a very advances baker, although, ever since that first batch of muffins, I always wanted to change something, wether it was to reduce the amount of sugar, to increase the amount of chocolate, add some extra chocolate chips (always a favorite for me), or completly create a healthier version of my baked goods. In the last few years, I have been experimenting with different recipes online, changing the quantity, or adding some ingredients. In My Baking Obsession, I have compiled my most successful baking experiments, that I wish to share with you.</p>
    <p>It's possible that you are not a baker and just need to find a quick cake recipe for your party tonight. In My Baking Obsession, you can find all kinds of recipes, from the simple chocolate muffins I first baked few years back, until the more complicated cake pops that I just recently tried out.</p>
