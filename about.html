      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>The day I first baked chocolate muffins, I never would have thought that baking would become an obsession. Today, my favorite part of the kitchen is the baking supplies I have, starting from my pink stand mixer, to my colorful measuring cups and spoons.</p>
      <p>I do not consider myself a very advanced baker, however, ever since that first batch of muffins, I always found myself wanting to change something, wether it was reducing the amount of sugar, increasing the amount of cocoa powder, adding some extra chocolate chips (always a favorite for me), or creating a healthier version. In the last few years, I have been experimenting with different recipes online, changing the quantity, or adding some ingredients, modifying them to my preferences. In My Baking Obsession, I have compiled my most successful baking experiments, that I wish to share with you.</p>
      <p>It's possible that you are not a baker and just need to find a quick cake recipe for your party tonight. In My Baking Obsession, you can find all kinds of <a class="intext" href="#">recipes</a>, from the simple chocolate muffins I first baked few years back, until the more complicated cake pops that I just recently tried out.</p>
